# Introduction

This document serves as a guide for LeanData's coding standards in the Javascript programming language.

A chunk or diff of code is described as style-compliant if and only if it adheres to the rules outlined here.

Like other programming style guides, the issues covered span not only aesthetic issues of formatting, but other types of conventions or coding standards as well. However, this document focuses primarily on the hard-and-fast rules that we can follow universally, and avoids giving advice that isn't clearly enforceable (whether by human or tool).

## Context

As LeanData's codebase and engineering team grow, minor variances between styles, even when equally valid, generate minor-to-major inefficiencies. The code velocity of an engineering team depends not only on each individual's skills in writing new code but also on their abilities to understand, review, debug and refactor existing code, all of which are predicated on the readability of the codebase.

As Google's style guide points out, "Every major open-source project has its own style guide: a set of conventions (sometimes arbitrary) about how to write code for that project. It is much easier to understand a large codebase when all the code in it is in a consistent style."

## Scope

The LeanData style guide was created organically, and does not seek to be comprehensively prescriptive. Rather, it is added to and edited as inconsistent styles are discovered and brought up. If an inconsistency in existing code is found, proper responses include adding a new issue or upvoting an existing issue, creating a pull requests with an edit onto the style guide, bringing up the issue in Slack.

The style guide does not seek to be prescriptive towards *existing* code. Instead, the expectation is that any *new* code added into the LeanData codebase is style-compliant. Likewise, editing existing lines of code should **only** make style-compliant the lines **directly** modified.

# Formatting

## Braces are used for all control structures

Braces are required for all control structures (i.e. `if`, `else`, `for`, `do`, `while`, as well as any others), even if the body contains only a single statement. The first statement of a non-empty block must begin on its own line.

**Exception**: A simple if statement that can fit entirely on a single line with no wrapping (and that doesnâ€™t have an `else`) may be kept on a single line with no braces when it improves readability. This is the only case in which a control structure may omit braces and newlines.

**Example**: `if (shortCondition()) return;`

## Block indentation: +2 spaces

Each time a new block or block-like construct is opened, the indent increases by two spaces. When the block ends, the indent returns to the previous indent level. The indent level applies to both code and comments throughout the block.

## Statements

Each statement belongs in its own line and should be followed by a semicolon and a line-break.

## Line-Wrapping and Column limit
JavaScript code has a column limit of `80` characters. Any line that would exceed this limit must be line-wrapped.

When line-wrapping, each line after the first (each continuation line) is indented at least +4 from the original line, unless it falls under the rules of block indentation.

When there are multiple continuation lines, indentation may be varied beyond +4 as appropriate. In general, continuation lines at a deeper syntactic level are indented by larger multiples of 4, and two lines use the same indentation level if and only if they begin with syntactically parallel elements.

**Note:** While the typical reason for line-wrapping is to avoid overflowing the column limit, even code that would in fact fit within the column limit may be line-wrapped at the author's discretion.

**Tip:** Extracting a method or local variable may solve the problem without the need to line-wrap.

## Horizontal Whitespace
Use of horizontal whitespace depends on location, and falls into three broad categories: *leading* (at the start of a line), *trailing* (at the end of a line), and *internal*. Leading whitespace (i.e., indentation) is addressed elsewhere. Trailing whitespace is **forbidden**.

Beyond where required by the language or other style rules, and apart from literals, comments, and JSDoc, a single internal ASCII space also appears in the following places only.

- Separating any reserved word (such as `if`, `for`, or `catch`) from an open parenthesis (`(`) that follows it on that line.
- Separating any reserved word (such as `else` or `catch`) from a closing curly brace (`}`) that precedes it on that line.
- Before any open curly brace (`{`), with two exceptions:
  - Before an object literal that is the first argument of a function or the first element in an array literal (e.g. `foo({a: [{c: d}]})`).
  - In a template expansion, as it is forbidden by the language (e.g. `abc{%= 1 + 2 %}def`).
- On both sides of any binary or ternary operator.
- After a comma (`,`) or semicolon (`;`). Note that spaces are never allowed before these characters.
- After the colon (`:`) in an object literal.
- On both sides of the double slash (`//`) that begins an end-of-line comment. Here, multiple spaces are allowed, but not required.
- After an open-JSDoc comment character and on both sides of close characters (e.g. for short-form type declarations or casts: t`his.foo = /** @type {number} */ (bar);` or `function(/** string */ foo) {`).

# Language Features

## Local variable declarations

### Use `const` and `let`
Declare all local variables with either `const` or `let`. Use `const` by default, unless a variable needs to be reassigned. The `var` keyword must not be used.

### Use trailing commas
Include a trailing comma whenever there is a line break between the final element and the closing bracket for both array literals and object literals.

Example:
```
const values = [
  'first value',
  'second value',
];
```

# Naming

Identifiers use only ASCII letters and digits, and, in a small number of cases noted below, underscores and very rarely (when required by frameworks like jQuery) dollar signs.

Give as descriptive a name as possible, within reason. Do not worry about saving horizontal space as it is far more important to make your code immediately understandable by a new reader. Do not use abbreviations that are ambiguous or unfamiliar to readers outside your project, and do not abbreviate by deleting letters within a word.

```
priceCountReader      // No abbreviation.
numErrors             // "num" is a widespread convention.
numDnsConnections     // Most people know what "DNS" stands for.
```

Illegal:
```
n                     // Meaningless.
nErr                  // Ambiguous abbreviation.
nCompConns            // Ambiguous abbreviation.
wgcConnections        // Only your group knows what this stands for.
pcReader              // Lots of things can be abbreviated "pc".
cstmrId               // Deletes internal letters.
kSecondsPerDay        // Do not use Hungarian notation.
```
